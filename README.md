## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Storage**:
    - Ingested raw collision data from open datasets using ETL pipelines.
    - Stored the processed data in a structured format using **AWS S3** and **Snowflake**.
- **Data Transformation**: 
    - Performed data profiling with Alteryx and **Python** (y-data profiling)
    - Cleaned and transformed data using Talend Studio for enhanced quality and consistency.
    - Designed a star schema in **Snowflake** to optimize query performance.
- **Visualization**:
    - Created dynamic dashboards using **Power BI** to visualize accident trends, hotspots, and patterns.
    - Enhanced decision-making with insights on peak accident times, high-risk zones, and causative factors.
